# SecretHitler

Completed as part of my Final Year project at QMUL

This repo is a recreation of the Secret Hitler Game, whilst also implementing some basic heuristics in order to have the non-plater agents play the game most efficiently.

The project was deemed very successful by advisors being marked 81%
